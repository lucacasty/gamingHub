However, his style of play relied on a lot of drag-backs, which were significantly nerfed in FIFA 21.</p>\n<p>It's clear that the Liverpool forward has been making the most of his spell on the sidelines following a painful knee injury sustained against FC Midtjylland in the Champion's League - and by making the most, we mean playing a lot of FIFA.

Whether you're a coach, a manager, or a team owner, you've got to keep them motivated despite the hurdles esports can throw at you. That means making sure they're hungry enough to win trophies and even making sure their FIFA Point balance is topped up enough so they can build the strongest in-game teams possible.</p>\n<p>It sounds exhausting, right? Now try managing six players, spread across three separate teams based in three different continents, all while trying to bring success to one of the most powerful entities in sport. Well, that's exactly what Saul Ashon has been doing as the esports executive for City Football Group - the holding company that owns ten football clubs around the world, most notably Manchester City in the Premier League.</p>\n<p>Not so long ago, the now 18-year-old was heading straight from an eight-hour flight from a FUT Champions Cup in Atlanta to his local college, trying to juggle FIFA coaching and his studies. Now, he's guided all three of his City Football Group teams to their respective regional finals of the FIFA eClub World Cup - a gruelling tournament that this year had over 450 teams enter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/man-city-esports-ecwc-2021\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/diogo-jota-weekend-league\">Diogo Jota is currently the best FIFA 21 Weekend League player in the world</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/future-stars-release-date\">FIFA 21 Future Stars returns to Ultimate Team this week</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/toty-sabitzer-sbc-solutions\">FIFA 21 TOTY Sabitzer SBC: Solutions, requirements, and price</a></p>",

The event sees the young players of today granted cards that represent how good they might become if they fulfil their potential.</p>\n<p>Last year's Future Stars promo went live a bit earlier in the year on January 31, but most Ultimate Team releases seem to have been delayed a little this season, likely due to the game's later release. The FIFA 20 event was headlined by Jo√£o F√©lix, who received a 92-rated card, but also saw upgrades for the likes of Mason Greenwood, Gabriel Martinelli, and Liverpool's new centre back Ozan Kabak - although he of course played for Schalke at the time.</p>\n<p>Last season also saw a couple of Upgradable Objectives Players added to the game, including then-Real Sociedad and current-Arsenal loanee Martin √òdegaard. These innovative challenges required you to complete a simple objective to unlock the player card, and then use the card to complete more objectives in order to upgrade it. FIFA fans will be hoping for a repeat of the fun objectives this time around.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/future-stars-release-date\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/diogo-jota-weekend-league\">Diogo Jota is currently the best FIFA 21 Weekend League player in the world</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/man-city-esports-ecwc-2021\">\"Not a lot of sleep\" - the secret to managing three FIFA esports teams across three continents</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/toty-sabitzer-sbc-solutions\">FIFA 21 TOTY Sabitzer SBC: Solutions, requirements, and price</a></p>",

Combine a stylish retro kit with one of the <a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/best-nicknames\">best FIFA 21 nicknames</a> to flex your team's superiority in Rivals or Weekend League - just make sure you've got the skill moves to back it up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-20\">FIFA 20</a> saw Liverpool's iconic 1989 'Candy' kit released into Ultimate Team via a handful of simple objectives, so we imagine EA will follow the same system this time around.

While TOTY staples such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos are featured, for the first time in FIFA Ultimate Team history there is no Lionel Messi in the TOTY.</p>\n<p>Joining Ronaldo in attack with delicious blue cards instead of Messi is Robert Lewandowski and FIFA 21 posterboy Kylian Mbappe. In the three-man midfield, Premier League duo Kevin De Bruyne and Bruno Fernandes star alongside Joshua Kimmich. The back four sees Sergio Ramos and Alphonso Davies next to Liverpool teammates Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold. This year's goalkeeper is a Manuel Neuer - a surprise considering the likes of Alisson and Ederson were in the mix.</p>\n<p>While it certainly feels strange not seeing Messi in a healthy hue of blue, this is certainly a stacked TOTY and it will only get more impressive as the stats of each set of players are released throughout the next week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/toty\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/toty-sabitzer-sbc-solutions\">FIFA 21 TOTY Sabitzer SBC: Solutions, requirements, and price</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/retro-kits-datamine\">FIFA 21 could be getting five retro kits</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/toty-stats-leaked\">FIFA 21 TOTY stats leaked ahead of today's release</a></p>",

Organised by the football governing body and not EA, the 2021 eClub World Cup sees professional FIFA esports players compete in regional conferences and divisions under a club banner with the overall goal of reaching the finals in their respective region.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/news/record-number-of-fifae-clubs-on-their-journey-to-reach-the-world-s-pinnacle-club\">over 450 clubs taking part</a> across all regions, spots in the final of each region were always going to be fiercely contested. In Europe though, it's just got a whole lot harder. That's because FIFA says the European finals will now only contain the top 14 teams (essentially the top team from each of the 14 European conferences) rather than the previously billed 28 (top two from every conference).</p>\n<p>According to a tweet from FIFA, a change in plans for the finals broadcast has forced them to cut the number of teams.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/eclub-world-cup-format-changes\">Read the rest of the story...</a></p>\n<p>RELATED LINKS:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/retro-kits-datamine\">FIFA 21 could be getting five retro kits</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/toty-stats-leaked\">FIFA 21 TOTY stats leaked ahead of today's release</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.theloadout.com/fifa-21/prime-gaming-drops\">FIFA 21 and Prime Gaming team up for nine drops - perfect for TOTY</a></p>",
